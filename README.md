The Taubat√© Pregnant is having her kids soon. The problem is that they are too many and she needs a system to register them. Furthermore, this is not her only pregnancy, she is planning to get pregnant again.

Since they are too many, you need to create a software where the doctor can register each of them, regardless the order it is inserted, and that may help her further, for instance, when she needs to call the kids for lunch, not to forget anyone.

Edu, a famous TV Presenter got emotional and is moving efforts to collect donations for the kids, since the donations are A LOT, it is important to handle these gifts as well.

The software should give the following possibilities for the users


* Add new baby
* List Babies by age
* List Babies by name
* Add gift
* List gifts


The class Baby should have the following methods:

    // public class Baby

    //Constructors:
    new Baby();
    new Baby(String birthday, String name, char gender)
    new Baby(Date birthday, String name, char gender)

    // Getters and Setters


    // If a given kid is older than the current one
    boolean isOlder(Baby baby)

    // The actual age of the kid in days
    int howOld()

You are free to create other methods that are not listed above and may help your development. ( cof cof toString cof cof equals )


The class Gift should handle the following information:

* Name of the person who gave the gift
* Description of the gift
* Date from when the gift was given

The class Gift has no strict implementation rules, but, you should follow the concepts and conventions learnt in class.

  * The software should already have some objects pre-filled (some persons and gifts)

  * Github delivered assignments will have the code considered until the last commit prior the deadline. (in case of none, the mark is zero);
  * The Class containing the main must be called **BabyRegister**;
  * Assignments containing IDE imports or IDE projects will not be considered.

## Libraries
  The following but not restricted to:
